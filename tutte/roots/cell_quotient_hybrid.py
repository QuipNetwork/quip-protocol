"""Cell-quotient HYBRID DP — cycle-close + per-leaf synth for cyclic
cell-quotients.

For graphs with cell-decomposable structure where the cell-quotient
contains cycles (e.g., D-Wave Cm graphs), this module peels one
closing junction at a time using the §4 chord rule and
computes each leaf via a configurable per-leaf synth callable.

The recursion has two paths through `recurse()`:

1. **Path A** (symmetric chord rule): when the closing junction's
   anchors don't share a vertex with any remaining junction's anchors
   (`_junction_symmetric` check), use the standard `C(k, j)` chord
   rule. This is the fast path for K_n / K_{a,b} cells.

2. **Path B** (orbit enumeration): when symmetric pre-check fails,
   enumerate all 2^k matching subsets, group leaves by canonical_key,
   and recurse once per orbit weighted by orbit size. Bridge factors
   are tracked sequentially via `_path_multiplier_fixed` along the
   fixed `present[0..k-1]` walk so Tutte's path-independence holds.
   This handles cross-junction shared anchors (e.g., 2x2 K_3 M_2 grid).

Both paths can dispatch to `compute_corrected_leaf_dp`
(`cell_quotient_tree.py`) at the top level when the closing junction's
removal makes the cell-topology a tree. This bypasses `engine.synthesize`
per leaf using the corrected vertex-identification convolution rule
(see `tutte/research/data/step3_milestone_b_design.md`).

Reuses the chord-rule primitives from
`tutte/graphs/covering.py:apply_kmatching_formula` (`_apply_junction_merge`,
`_is_bridge_junction`). The DIFFERENCE from `apply_kmatching_formula`
is that we BYPASS the P3 gate via `_detect_kmatching_topology_no_p3`
(needed to handle shared-anchor cyclic cell-topologies that the
existing recursion's parallel-edge bookkeeping mishandles).

See plan: `~/.claude/plans/we-are-working-in-magical-forest.md`.
