"""Process-level parallelism for Tutte polynomial synthesis.

Parallelizes the two independent recursive calls in _batch_reduce_parallel:
when reducing k parallel edges between u,v, T(G₀) and T(G_c) are independent
and can be computed on separate cores.

Uses ProcessPoolExecutor with 2 workers. Each worker gets its own
HybridSynthesisEngine with a snapshot of the main cache. New cache entries
discovered by workers are merged back into the main engine.
