"""Polynomial Factorization and GCD for Tutte Polynomials.

This module provides algorithms for computing GCDs and factorizations
of bivariate Tutte polynomials. These are used for:
1. Finding shared factors between polynomials (GCD-based minor relationships)
2. Algebraic decomposition in synthesis
3. Identifying polynomial structure for k-join operations

Key algorithms:
- Bivariate polynomial GCD using subresultant algorithm
- Monomial content extraction
- Primitive part computation
