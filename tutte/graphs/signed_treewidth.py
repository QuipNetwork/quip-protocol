"""Signed-graph treewidth DP for σ-equivariant Tutte polynomial.

Computes T_signed(G_base, χ; x_0, y_0, p) at a single integer point mod p
for a signed multigraph (V, E, χ : E → Z_2). Uses bag-by-bag DP on the
existing TreeDecomposition infrastructure with sign-aware partition state.

KEY: at each bag, state tracks ONLY bag vertices. As we move up the tree
decomposition, vertices outside the parent bag are FORGOTTEN, which
permanently consolidates their balance into the "rank deficit accumulator".

State per bag: dict {(partition, monodromy, balance, finalized_balance_deficit):
                     weight_int_mod_p}
  - partition: tuple of block ID per bag vertex (canonicalized)
  - monodromy: tuple of mon bit per bag vertex (rebased per block)
  - balance: tuple of bool per current block
  - finalized_balance_deficit: accumulated rank deficit from forgotten
    components (each forgotten unbalanced block adds 1 to rank, balanced
    adds 0)

Final answer aggregates over the empty-bag state with appropriate factors.
