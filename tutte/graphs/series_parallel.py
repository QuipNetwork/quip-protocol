"""Series-Parallel Graph Recognition and Decomposition.

A 2-terminal series-parallel graph can be reduced to a single edge using:
- Series reduction: Remove degree-2 vertex, connect its neighbors
- Parallel reduction: Merge multiple edges between same endpoints

Series-parallel graphs have treewidth ≤ 2.

This module also provides:
- SPNode: Decomposition tree for series-parallel graphs
- decompose_series_parallel: Build the decomposition tree during reduction
- compute_sp_tutte: Compute Tutte polynomial from decomposition tree in O(n) time
