"""Transfer Matrix module for computing Tutte polynomials of lattice strip graphs.

Detects periodic lattice strips (grid, triangular, honeycomb, square-octagon,
elongated triangular) and computes
their Tutte polynomials via transfer-matrix multiplication over non-crossing
partition states. Includes a C-accelerated path (cffi) with CRT fallback
for large coefficients.

Pipeline: lattice detection -> transfer matrix build -> matrix-vector sweep
-> FK extraction -> Tutte polynomial.

    detect_periodic_strip(graph, fp) -> Optional[StripProperties]

    Detects whether the graph is a periodic lattice strip (grid, triangular,

    pattern, runs matrix-vector multiplication across all columns, and
    extracts the Tutte polynomial from the final FK state vector.

    Tries a C-accelerated path first (full sweep in C, binomial conversion
    in Python). Falls back to pure Python if the C extension is unavailable.
