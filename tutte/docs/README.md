> **Why family recognition runs first**: it costs `O(n + m)` and skips
> the canonical-key computation (which is `O(n² × d)`). For known
> parametric families — trees, cycles, wheels, fans, ladders, prisms,
> books, gears, Möbius ladders, grids — the polynomial is computed
> directly from a closed-form formula or constant-coefficient
> recurrence in `n`.

> **Why treewidth_dp runs after the cell-quotient paths**: closed-form
> formulas and cell-quotient DPs (when applicable) beat the
> general-purpose treewidth DP on cell-decomposable D-Wave-style
> graphs. When neither applies, the treewidth DP wins outright for
> `tw ≤ 11`. The chord-rule paths take over for graphs whose
> treewidth exceeds the cap.

## Technique index

The numbering reflects the engine cascade order in
`tutte/synthesis/engine.py::_synthesize_inner`. Step numbers may have
fractional sub-steps where the engine has multiple variants of the
same family of techniques (e.g., cell-quotient DPs).

## Hierarchical Tiling — how it works

For a graph with `k` disjoint cells `C_1, …, C_k` (each isomorphic to
a known minor) connected by some inter-cell edges:

**boundary quotient** (when no chords in the inter-cell graph):

```
T(target) = [∏_i T(C_i)] · T(B) / [∏_i T(B_i)]
```

where `B` is the induced subgraph on all boundary nodes (cell vertices
touched by inter-cell edges) plus all inter-cell edges plus intra-cell
edges among boundary nodes; `B_i` is each cell's boundary-induced
subgraph.

**chord recursion** (iterative chord rule, peels off cycle-creating
inter-cell edges):

```
T(target) = T(target − all chords) + Σ_i T((target − chord_1 − … − chord_{i-1}) / chord_i)
```

Each contraction leaf is synthesized as a multigraph (parallel edges
and loops are preserved).

**Cost**: `1 + chord_count` full syntheses. Linear in the cyclic
complexity of the inter-cell graph.

**Implementation**: `tutte/graphs/k_sum.py::boundary_quotient_tutte`.

## k-Sum Decomposition — how it works

For a graph with a `k`-vertex separator `S` (i.e., removing `S`
disconnects the graph):

```
PC = target + missing K_k clique edges       (parallel completion)
T(target) = T(PC) − Σ_i T((PC − e_1 − … − e_{i-1}) / e_i)
```

This is the iterative chord rule applied to the `K_k` clique edges.
**Cost**: `1 + C(k, 2)` full syntheses. For `k = 2`: 2; for `k = 3`:
4; for `k = 4`: 7.

When the separator already contains the full `K_k` clique (no edges
missing), the engine peels the existing clique edges instead — same
cost.

**Implementation**: `tutte/graphs/k_sum.py::clique_chord_k_sum`.

## Treewidth DP fallback

Used when neither cell-quotient DPs nor closed-form formulas apply.
Builds a tree decomposition of width ≤ `max_width` (default 11) and
runs a bag-by-bag dynamic program in C (via cffi).

The C path is gated to `5 ≤ tw ≤ 10` where head-to-head benchmarks
show it beats the pure-Python wrapper. For graphs with coefficients
exceeding `int64`, the modular-CRT path activates at `m > 62`.

## Package READMEs

The synthesis engine is split across several subpackages; each has its
own README with module-level details:

- [`tutte/synthesis/`](../synthesis/README.md) — `SynthesisEngine`,
  `HybridSynthesisEngine`, and the shared `BaseMultigraphSynthesizer`.
- [`tutte/graphs/`](../graphs/README.md) — series-parallel, treewidth
  DP, k-sum chord rule, signed/σ-equivariant DPs.
- [`tutte/roots/`](../roots/README.md) — cell-quotient cycle / grid /
  tree DPs, chain recurrence, modular point-value pathways.
- [`tutte/lookup/`](../lookup/README.md) — rainbow table, canonical
  keys, binary serialisation.
- [`tutte/transfer_matrix/`](../transfer_matrix/README.md) — periodic
  lattice strips via Fortuin-Kasteleyn transfer matrix.
- [`tutte/data/`](../data/README.md) — pre-computed lookup tables.
- [`tutte/tests/`](../tests/README.md) — parametrised test suite.
- [`tutte/benchmarks/`](../benchmarks/README.md) — standalone benchmark
  sweep (CEJ + Hybrid + NetworkX).

## Engine variants

- **`SynthesisEngine`** — primary cascade (steps 1–11 above).
- **`HybridSynthesisEngine`** — structural-first variant; delegates to
  `SynthesisEngine` for the structural decomposition step.
- **`AlgebraicSynthesisEngine`** — polynomial-level GCD decomposition,
  used by the visualizer for explanatory output.

## Benchmarks

The benchmark suite (`tutte/benchmarks/benchmark.py`) measures
wall-clock synthesis time across three engines, starting from an
empty rainbow table. After each successful synthesis, the computed
polynomial is added to the engine's rainbow table so subsequent
graphs may use it as a tile or minor. Graphs are processed in
ascending order of edge count.

### Engines compared

| Engine                               | Description                                   | Default Timeout |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **CEJ** (`SynthesisEngine`)          | Steps 1–11 with growing rainbow table         | 60s             |
| **Hybrid** (`HybridSynthesisEngine`) | Algebraic + tiling with growing rainbow table | 60s             |
| **NetworkX** (`nx.tutte_polynomial`) | Reference deletion-contraction (no table)     | 30s             |

### Graph set

Built from three sources, deduplicated by canonical key, sorted by
edge count: named graphs (K_3–K_7, cycles, wheels, Petersen, small
grids), `nx.graph_atlas(1..1252)`, and D-Wave topologies (Chimera Cm_1
… Cm_16, Pegasus Pm_1 … Pm_16, Zephyr Z(1, 1)).

### Verification

Every result is checked against Kirchhoff's matrix-tree theorem:
`T(1, 1)` must equal the number of spanning trees. When both a
synthesis engine and NetworkX produce a polynomial for the same graph,
they are cross-validated for exact equality.

### Usage

```bash
python -m tutte.benchmarks.benchmark                          # default
python -m tutte.benchmarks.benchmark --timeout 300            # extend timeout
python -m tutte.benchmarks.benchmark --compare a.json b.json  # diff two runs
