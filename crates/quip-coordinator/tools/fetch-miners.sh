#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Fetch the miner binaries a host (or image) needs from the standalone miner
# repos' GitLab package registries, into a local bin dir the coordinator's
# config.toml points at. Miners now live in their own repos and publish
# per-platform binaries as generic-package assets; the coordinator no longer
# builds them.
#
# Single source of truth: the container images (docker/Dockerfile.quip-miner*)
# and the native/host install both call this script instead of duplicating the
# fetch logic.
#
# Usage: fetch-miners.sh [DEST_DIR]        (default: ./miners)
# Env:
#   MINERS_TAG  release tag for the cpu, cuda and metal miners
#               (default: v0.3.0-rc2).
#   DWAVE_MINERS_TAG
#               release tag for the dwave miner (default: v0.3.0-rc3). Separate
#               because the miners version independently.
#   MINER_SET   which miners to fetch:
#                 auto      (default) derive from this host's OS/arch —
#                           Linux -> cpu (+cuda if amd64, optional);
#                           Darwin/arm64 -> metal + cpu.
#                 cpu       cpu miners only (any arch).
#                 cpu-cuda  cpu + cuda miners (cuda required; amd64 only).
#   DRY_RUN     if set, print the assets that would be fetched and exit 0
#               without downloading (used by the CI verify job).
#   TARGETARCH  explicit target arch (amd64|arm64) for docker builds; defaults
#               to `uname -m` for the native/host install.
#   TARGETOS    explicit target OS (linux|darwin); defaults to `uname -s`.
#
# Assets are published as "<name>-<os>-<arch>" but saved locally as "<name>"
# (no suffix) to match config.toml's `binary = "quip-cpu-sa"` references. The
# OS is part of the name because arch alone is ambiguous: the cpu miner ships
# both a linux-arm64 and a darwin-arm64 build.
#
# NOTE: a real (non-DRY_RUN) run needs the miner repos to have cut releases at
# the tags above. cpu, cuda and metal are released at v0.3.0-rc2; dwave is at
# v0.3.0-rc3, which is the first release carrying its macOS binary.
